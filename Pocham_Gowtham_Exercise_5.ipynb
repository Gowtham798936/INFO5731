        "The results of the different clustering methods and embedding techniques vary significantly. K-means clustering resulted in a very low silhouette score of 0.0059, indicating poor cluster separation. DBSCAN, on the other hand, failed to find meaningful clusters, with only one cluster identified and a large number of points classified as noise (3793). Hierarchical clustering yielded a slightly higher silhouette score of 0.0169, suggesting better clustering than K-means but still relatively weak separation. When using Word2Vec embeddings with K-means, a significantly higher silhouette score of 0.5001 was achieved, indicating much better cluster separation compared to other methods. Finally, employing BERT embeddings with K-means resulted in a silhouette score of 0.0319, which is higher than traditional text-based clustering methods but lower than Word2Vec. Overall, Word2Vec embeddings combined with K-means clustering appear to be the most effective approach for clustering in this scenario, while BERT embeddings show promise but may require further tuning or optimization.\n",
